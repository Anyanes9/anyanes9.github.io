      <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/">Add me! <a/>
    <p> I was born in El Salvador, but I have been living in the United States for the past 9 years. I speak two Languages, but I would love to learn more, and I hope to travel the world.
    I love reading books, and my favorite book is Behind the Beautiful Forevers by Katherine Boo. I will be attending Carleton College in the fall, where I will try to survive the freezing weather of Minnesota. </p>
